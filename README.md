## Design
### Colour scheme
- This website is here to provide a starting point for people seeking more peace in their lives, so the colour scheme needs to reflect that so looks of white has been used along with a light kaki green (rgba 214, 220, 207) along with soft greys (#3a3a3a) used for text and blended in with images as an overlaying background.
### Typography
- The main text font is Roboto which is used throughout at various weights for readability for varying screen sizes and paired with Montserrat for the headers.
### Imagery
- The images used on the website have been selected to give the feeling of everyday life and a sense of casualness. This is to give the feeling to the user that mindfulness, yoga and meditation can be incorporated seamlessly into their without affecting their work/life balance.
### Wireframes
- The wireframes were created using Mockplus, theses wireframes were followed almost exactly apart from slight tweaks needed for better usability on some screen sizes. Also, the addition of a contact page was added later which followed a similar design as the home page only with another for located above the sign up form.
