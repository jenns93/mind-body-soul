## Typography
- The main text font is roboto which is used throught at various weights for readability for varying screen sizes and paired with Montserrat for the headers.
## Imagery
- The images used in the website have been selected to give the feeling of everyday life and a sense of casualness. This is to give the feeling to the user that mindfulness, yoga and meditation can be incorperated seemlesly into thier lives without affecting their work/life balance.

Also the addition of a contact page was added later which followed a similar design as the home page only with another for located above the sign up form.
